# PSTAT 175 Final Project
## by Hannah Mok, Caleb Mazariegos, Joshua Price

For this survival analysis project, we will analyze the lengths of Canadian senators’ terms in office. 
The data for this project is sourced from the Python package “lifelines” created by Cameron Davidson-Pilon, which has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software in August 2019. 
The main goal of our project is to identify how long Canadian senators are able to stay in office before ending their term due to death, retirement, resignation, or declining the appointment.
